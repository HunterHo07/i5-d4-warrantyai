# WarrantyAI - Smart Warranty Management Platform

> **Never miss a warranty again. Own smart. Live smart.**

WarrantyAI is a futuristic MVP simulation platform that combines real-world warranty tracking functionality with immersive frontend effects and instant-ready product visuals for startups, demos, and investors.

## 🚀 The Problem We Solve

- **70%+ of consumers** forget or misplace receipts
- **Average household** owns 25+ items with service/warranty coverage
- Manual tracking of product warranties is chaotic and inefficient
- No single tool covers everything: electronics, home appliances, vehicles, and even food freshness
- Missed claims = lost value. Fake claims = lack of trust.

## 💡 Our Solution

- **Electronics & Appliances** - Phones, laptops, TVs, refrigerators
- **Home & Vehicle** - AC filters, car oil changes, roof warranties
